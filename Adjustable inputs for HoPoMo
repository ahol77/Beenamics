Queen Egg Laying
	-xi: Parameters that influence the shape of the season factor and can be adjusted to adjust for different climates

	-SUPthreshold:

	+CELLSperframe:
	+FRAMESperhive:

	ELRstochrange:
	ELRbase: mean daily egg laying rate of the queen at the maximum egg laying peak in Spring

Brood development

	*LIFESPANegg: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed
	*LIFESPANlarvae: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed
	*LIFESPANpupa: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed


	INITeggs: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony
	INITlarvae: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony
	INItpupae: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony

	MORTALITYeggs: Daily egg mortality, treated as a constant in this model
