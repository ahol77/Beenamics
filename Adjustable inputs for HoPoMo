* : Literature value
- : Likely to be removed
+ : Empirical data we already have/can get
? : Do not have immediate path to value, will talk with Mellisphera

Queen Egg Laying
	-xi: Parameters that influence the shape of the season factor and can be adjusted to adjust for different climates

	-SUPthreshold: Determines the threshold for empty cells below which Queen's egg laying behavior becomes suppressed

	+CELLSperframe: Cells per frame in hive
	+FRAMESperhive: Frames per hive

	?ELRstochrange: Determines the passible range for the stochastic affects on queen egg laying rate 
	?ELRbase: mean daily egg laying rate of the queen at the maximum egg laying peak in Spring

Brood development

	*LIFESPANegg: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed
	*LIFESPANlarvae: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed
	*LIFESPANpupa: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed


	INITeggs: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony
	INITlarvae: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony
	INItpupae: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony

	MORTALITYeggs: Daily egg mortality, treated as a constant in this model 
	?MORTALITYlarvae: Time independent base mortality of larvae
	MORTALITYpupae: Mortality rate of pupae, treated as a constant here; usually signicantly smaller than that for eggs or larva

Adult bees
	?MORTALITYadultbase: Constant mortality rates for adult bees
	?MORTALITYnursing: Constant mortality rate for nursing bees
	?MORTALITYprocessing: Constant mortality rate for processing bees
	?MORTALITYforaging: Constant mortality rate for foraging bees

Modeling Task Decision Making
	?FACTORothertasks: Accounts for fraction of adult bee population engaged in tasks not modeled, such as guarding, cleaning, etc.


Modeling the regulation of foraging
	?POLLENNEEDadult: daily pollen demand of a basic adult bee 
	?POLLENNEDDnurse: additional daily pollen demand of nurses
	
	?FACTORpollenstorage: Constant that represents the storage level of pollen maintained by a hive, a value of 3 means that the hive stores enough pollen to last about 3 days, based on current levels of demand. Likely a genetic factor
	
	?LOADpollenforager: The amount of pollen collected in foraging trip, in units of cellfulls
	?TURNSpollenforager: The number of trips made in a day by a pollen forager

	?FACTORforagingmax: Sets limit on the total number of foragers on a given day
	?FACTORforagingsuccess: Expresses the overall success rate of faraging trips
	-FACTORminpollenforagers: Corrects for fact that, regardless of pollen need, there is some minimum number of pollen foragers in a cohort of bees

	?FACTORforagingstoch: defines range for fluctuations for foraging success rates

Modeling food regulation
	
	?ProcessorsPerCell: The number of processing bees required to process and store a cell of nectar

	?FACTORpollensavingmax: Physiological component of a hive that represents the maximum fraction of pollen that can be saved by a hive through reducing consumption rate

	RATIOnectar_to_honey: Describes the decrease in volume associated with the concentration of nectar to honey

	?wpollen: The weight of 1 cell filled with the respective material, in grams
	?wnectar: The weight of 1 cell filled with the respective material, in grams
	?whoney: The weight of 1 cell filled with the respective material, in grams
