Adjustable inputs for HoPoMo

* : Literature value
- : Likely to be removed
+ : Empirical data we already have/can get
? : Do not have immediate path to value, will talk with Mellisphera

Queen Egg Laying
	-xi: Parameters that influence the shape of the season factor and can be adjusted to adjust for different climates

	-SUPthreshold: Determines the threshold for empty cells below which Queen's egg laying behavior becomes suppressed

	+CELLSperframe: Cells per frame in hive
	+FRAMESperhive: Frames per hive

	?ELRstochrange: Determines the passible range for the stochastic affects on queen egg laying rate 
	?ELRbase: mean daily egg laying rate of the queen at the maximum egg laying peak in Spring

Brood development

	*LIFESPANegg: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed
	*LIFESPANlarvae: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed
	*LIFESPANpupa: represents time required for brood development (in days). Likely does not need to be changed


	INITeggs: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony
	INITlarvae: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony
	INItpupae: Constants that represent the initial population state of the colony

	MORTALITYeggs: Daily egg mortality, treated as a constant in this model
